# Meeting Moods

![Cover image of the Meeting Moods homepage](/public/readme-cover.png)

A full-stack web application to help bring cheer and delight to boring meetings built with Next.js, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.

What started as a fun joke with my team at work eventually developed into a full-stack side project a year later. Enjoy!
